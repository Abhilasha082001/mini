# mini
so, it's a mini project entirely prepared using react and firebase. 

features:

1.Authentication using firebase authentication.
2.Text area to write and post wishes.
3.Users can like and comment on various posts.
4.Logout to exit.


User interface is built on React.js, data(wishes,likes,comments) is stored on firebase store , as this app doesn't need more storage, that's why firebase storage is not used and also it is paid.
